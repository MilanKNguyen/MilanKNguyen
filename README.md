projects i have done: (this is more for myself to keep track) -------------------------
- CSC 1351 : This project showcases my skills in Java programming, as I have developed an exciting adventure collecting roleplaying game. Utilizing a basic graphics package provided by my professor, the game immerses players in a visually captivating world. Embark on an exhilarating journey filled with challenging quests, beautiful maps, and valuable item collection. With intuitive controls and captivating gameplay, this project demonstrates my ability to create an engaging gaming experience that combines exploration, roleplaying, and doodly charm.

- OOD : As a member of a collaborative group project, I worked on the front-end development for an exciting website called Pekan Pi. Our aim was to tackle food waste by creating a website that generates recipes using ingredients already present in your pantry. Through my expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Material UI, we crafted an intuitive and user-friendly interface that allows users to input their available ingredients and instantly receive recipe suggestions. Pekan Pi empowers individuals to make the most of what they have, promoting sustainability and minimizing food waste in an effortless and delicious way.
